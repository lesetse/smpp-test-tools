 * Send elink too slow
 * Do not response with elink_resp
 * Unexpectedly drop connection (close socket without unbind)
 * Do not response to deliver_sm
 * Trying to connect with many sessions (semibad)
 * Do not wait for unbind (semibad)

 * Drop connection on error in resp
 * Drop connection after request packet send
 * Sending submit_sm with expired absolute validity_period
 * Sending submit_sm with expired absolute scheduled_delivery_time

 * Bind session for a single message
 * Send esm_class = 1 (datagram mode) with submit_sm and registered_delivery flag

 * Using + or 00 in International numbers (TON/NPI 1/1)
 * Using shortnumbers with incorrect TON/NPI
 UDH / SAR concatination:
 * Incorrect length for SAR-concatination (short_message longer than 134 octets)
 * Incorrect length for UDH-concatination (short_message longer than 134 octets without UDH)
 * Incorrect UDH-concatination (8 bit/16 bit/custom)
 * Incorrect esm_class with UDH
 * Incorrect number of messages and message number (semibad)
 * Incorrect order of parts (semibad)
 * Sending not all parts with current connection (semibad)
